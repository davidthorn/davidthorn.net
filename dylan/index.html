<h2>Welcome to David Thorn's Personal Website</h2>

<hr>

<p>
	This website is designed for me to display my own personal thoughts and ideas which I would like to show to others.
</p>

<p>
	As you can see there is not much on the webpage, this would be because I only bought it recently.
</p>

	If you would like to contact me directly please feel free to email me on <a href="mailto:info@davidthorn.net">info@davidthorn.net</a>
